Analyze, forecast, and understand time series data with ARIMA models. This repository provides code and guidance for implementing ARIMA models, exploring patterns in time series data, and generating forecasts. The ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model is one of the most popular methods for time series forecasting.

## üåü Introduction

The ARIMA Time Series Analysis (TSA) project is designed to help data scientists and analysts model and forecast univariate time series data. This repo demonstrates:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on time series data
- Model selection, parameter tuning, and evaluation of ARIMA models
- Forecasting future values based on historical data patterns

The techniques here are widely used in finance, retail, and other industries where temporal patterns are significant.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive EDA** for time series data: trend, seasonality, and stationarity tests
- **ARIMA Model Implementation**: step-by-step guidance to fit, tune, and interpret ARIMA models
- **Automated Parameter Selection** with grid search (AIC/BIC optimization)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MSE, RMSE, and MAE for model performance assessment
- **Forecasting** with confidence intervals and visualization
